# Viaduct Skills

Documentation for AI coding agents working with the Viaduct GraphQL framework.

## Installation

There are two ways to install Viaduct skills:

### Option 1: AGENTS.md Integration (Recommended)

Run from your Viaduct project root:

```bash
npx @viaduct-dev/skills
```

This will:
1. Copy documentation files to `.viaduct/agents/`
2. Add a task-to-doc mapping to your `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`)
3. Update `.gitignore` to exclude the generated docs

The task mapping tells Claude which doc to read before implementing each type of task.

**This is the most reliable method based on evaluation testing** — it achieved 100% pass rate compared to 40% without skills.

### Option 2: Micro-Skills via skills.sh

Install all Viaduct skills using the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) CLI:

```bash
npx skills add viaduct-dev/viaduct-skills
```

This installs all micro-skills from the `skills/` directory. Each skill is triggered automatically based on task context.

**Manual installation for Claude Code:**

```bash
cp -r skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**For claude.ai:**

Add individual skill files to project knowledge, or paste SKILL.md contents into the conversation.
